### But you can call me Jules.
I'm a full stack software engineer and '22 grad from the University of Notre Dame. I'm passionate about programming, sports, meaningful conversations, and learning new things. 

:woman_technologist: I'm currently working as a jack-of-all-trades SWE @ Publicis Sapient in NYC, where I'm designing an efficient web scraping solution that can transform retail site data into a Salesforce Commerce Cloud site. I've also done web development with React and Java Spring Boot.
