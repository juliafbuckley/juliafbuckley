I'm a full stack software engineer and '22 grad from the University of Notre Dame. I'm passionate about programming, sports, meaningful conversations, and learning new things. 

:woman_technologist: I'm currently working as a jack-of-all-trades SWE @ Publicis Sapient in NYC, where I'm designing an efficient web scraping solution that can transform retail site data into a Salesforce Commerce Cloud site. I've also done web development with React and Java Spring Boot.

:school: I'm excited about my current personal project, you should check it out!

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning GCP as I work on deploying my first website.
